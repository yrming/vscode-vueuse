## Why

- I often use [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) to develop Vue applications, but I find that everytime I want to look up for certain function, I have to shift my sight from vscode to the browser, which really interrupts my thoughts. So I developed this extension which applies the same interaction design of the official website, to help us stay focused and keep efficient during programming.
- The official extension seems to be no longer maintained.

## Features

- View functions in the side panel
- Search function
- Show documentation for each function
- Dark/Light mode
